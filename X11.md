# x11

Depends on [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) and Docker.

XQuartz authorization not supported yet, so turn it off. XQuartz > Settings > Security, NO Authenticate connections, YES Allow connections from network clients.

Maybe relevant commands:

```sh
xhost +
xhost +local:docker
xhost +local:root
```

Seems like I'm dependent on Docker GPU support.
